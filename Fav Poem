This is my favorite sonnet          
            
            One Bucket
Shall I eat only one bucket a day?
KFC makes you feel like a winner.
Thou’st chicken comes in three different ways.
Original, crispy or grilled dinner.
Chicken so good your lickin’ your fingers.
With batter fried on them so perfectly.
The taste is so good it always lingers.
Their food is never made incorrectly
Chicken is half of the experience.
Coleslaw is a superb choice of a side
The crisp lettuce with all of its brilliance. 
The mashed potatoes never left us dried.
I think the decision has been contrived 
If I don’t eat KFC i'll be deprived
